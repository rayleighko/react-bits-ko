# Using indexes as keys
Keys should be stable, predictable, and unique so that React can keep track of elements.

#### Bad
In this snippet each element's key will be based on ordering, rather than tied to the data that is being represented. This limits the optimizations that React can do.
```javascript
{todos.map((todo, index) =>
  <Todo
    {...todo}
    key={index}
  />
)}
```

#### Good
Assuming `todo.id` is unique to this list and stable, React would be able to reorder elements without needing to reevaluate them as much.
```javascript
{todos.map((todo) =>
  <Todo {...todo}
    key={todo.id} />
)}
```
